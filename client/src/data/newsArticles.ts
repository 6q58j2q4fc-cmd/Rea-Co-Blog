## Luxury Home Market Thrives in Central Oregon

The custom home market in Bend and surrounding areas continues to see increased demand for high-end properties, with Brasada Ranch and Tetherow leading the way in sales volume and price appreciation.

### Market Overview

According to recent data from the Central Oregon Association of Realtors, the luxury home segment (properties over $1.5 million) saw a 23% increase in sales volume compared to the previous year. This growth outpaced the overall market, which grew by 12% during the same period.

### Key Drivers

Several factors are contributing to the strong luxury market:

**Remote Work Migration**: Professionals from the Bay Area, Seattle, and Portland continue to relocate to Central Oregon, bringing significant purchasing power and seeking custom homes that accommodate home offices.

**Quality of Life**: The region's outdoor recreation opportunities, including skiing at Mount Bachelor, world-class golf, and extensive trail systems, attract affluent buyers seeking an active lifestyle.

**Limited Inventory**: The scarcity of move-in ready luxury homes has pushed more buyers toward custom construction, benefiting experienced builders like Kevin Rea at Rea Co Homes.

### Community Spotlight

**Brasada Ranch** continues to be the top-performing luxury community, with average home prices exceeding $2.5 million. The community's resort amenities and stunning high desert setting attract buyers from across the country.

**Tetherow** has seen particularly strong demand for golf course homesites, with several new custom homes currently under construction.

### Builder Perspective

"We're seeing unprecedented demand for quality custom homes," says Kevin Rea, owner of Rea Co Homes. "Buyers are willing to wait for the right home rather than compromise on their vision. They want homes that take full advantage of our incredible setting."

### Looking Ahead

Industry experts predict continued strength in the luxury segment through 2026, with particular growth expected in communities offering resort-style amenities and mountain views.

For those considering building a custom home in Central Oregon, now is an excellent time to secure a homesite and begin the planning process.

## Green Building Becomes Standard in Central Oregon

Central Oregon builders are increasingly incorporating energy-efficient designs and sustainable materials in custom home construction, responding to both client demand and the region's unique climate challenges.

### The Shift to Sustainability

What was once a niche market has become mainstream. Today's luxury home buyers expect their custom homes to be both beautiful and environmentally responsible.

### Builder Innovations

Kevin Rea of Rea Co Homes has been at the forefront of sustainable building in Central Oregon. "Our clients want homes that are comfortable, efficient, and responsible," Rea explains. "We've found that sustainable features often enhance the home's performance and reduce long-term operating costs."

### Certification Programs

Several certification programs are gaining popularity in the region:
- **Earth Advantage**: Oregon's green building certification
- **Energy Star**: EPA's energy efficiency program
- **LEED for Homes**: The gold standard in green building

### Economic Benefits

Sustainable homes offer tangible financial benefits:
- Lower utility bills (often 40-60% less than conventional homes)
- Higher resale values
- Available tax credits and incentives
- Reduced maintenance costs

### Looking Forward

As building codes continue to evolve and client expectations increase, sustainable building practices will become even more integral to custom home construction in Central Oregon.
