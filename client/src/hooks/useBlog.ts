# The Art of Building Custom Homes in the High Desert

The Oregon high desert presents unique opportunities and challenges for custom home builders. With over 45 years of experience, Kevin Rea has mastered the art of creating homes that thrive in this distinctive environment.

## Understanding the High Desert Climate

Central Oregon's high desert climate is characterized by:

- **300+ days of sunshine** annually
- **Low humidity** year-round
- **Significant temperature variations** between day and night
- **Occasional heavy snowfall** in winter
- **Dry summers** with wildfire considerations

## Design Considerations

### Orientation & Solar Gain

Smart home design in the high desert takes advantage of passive solar heating. South-facing windows capture winter sun while deep overhangs provide summer shade.

### Materials Selection

The high desert environment demands materials that can withstand:
- UV exposure
- Temperature extremes
- Low humidity
- Occasional severe weather

### Energy Efficiency

High desert homes benefit from:
- High-performance insulation
- Triple-pane windows
- Radiant floor heating
- Solar panel integration

## Why Experience Matters

Building in the high desert isn't like building anywhere else. Kevin Rea's four decades of experience mean:

- Understanding of local soil conditions
- Knowledge of water table and drainage requirements
- Relationships with skilled local subcontractors
- Familiarity with county building codes and requirements

## Start Your High Desert Dream
